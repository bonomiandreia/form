## Describe possible optimizations for your code

- improvements in logic in buttons back/next steps. 
- unit testing 
- improvements in CSS / layout (equal Wunder Mobility site)
- better names for components 

## Which things could be done better, than youâ€™ve done it?

-  Choose another lib than steppers. I haven't  tried a different lib because I'm familiar to angular material stepper, but in this case isn't the optimal to use in Forms due some bugs it may happen in the header
